Alright, I need to find highly-rated restaurants and dining experiences in Tokyo for each day of the 10-day itinerary, along with scenic locations and fun activities. The traveler is coming from Mumbai, so maybe they'd appreciate both local Japanese cuisine and perhaps some Indian options if available. Let me start with Day 1: Asakusa. Senso-ji Temple and Tokyo Skytree are already mentioned. For lunch near Asakusa, maybe a traditional tempura place. Let me search for top-rated restaurants in Asakusa.[00m

The rice is soggy and the shrimp tempura too? ? ? Really disappointed as I had high expectations
I'll never go again

The strange thing is that no one at the store greets me.
I have to say good morning, I have to say hello.
I went with 4 people and I am really disappointed.
I feel really sorry for the person I took with me.
The shop's history lives up to its name, and the work is thorough and worth the price.
I want customers to be treated politely, so I would like to ask my acquaintances, friends, and foreigners to treat me politely.

Ueno, Asakusa Traces of the history and culture of the Edo (old Tokyo) era remain vividly in Ueno and Asakusa. Spacious Ueno Park is a great place to relax and visit a variety of different museums and galleries. At Ameyoko which starts in front of Ueno station, the grocery stores and clothing shops are crammed alongside fishmongers. It gets particularly busy at the end of the year, when many people go on shopping sprees. The town of Asakusa, developed around Sensoji temple, has many shops selling goods and clothing from old Japan, making it a great place for souvenir hunting. It's also known for various annual festivals, and the whole district gets involved with the huge Sanja Festival in May.

Established in 1870, Tempura Nakasei is known for its kakiage-don (┬Ñ3,300), topped with crispy prawn and clam kakiage. Featuring a garden with carps swimming in the pond, the atmosphere here is like that of a traditional ryotei restaurant.
